# responsive-bootstrap-portfolio
Portfolio using bootstrap classes to make site responsive
I started this project by getting the offical bootstrap cdn from getbootstrap.com
I then constructed the html to have semantic tags.
I made three html files and linked the together.
I added a nav bar and a card from bootstrap as well as backround images for the other pages.
I aslo made sure the nav bar was consistent with the other html files.
The page was created resposive for mobile first.
